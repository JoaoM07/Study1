# Setting up your headset so you can load the experiment 

Ignore this step if you already have a Sidequest account and have setup your headset to load games from this plateform.
Otherwise, you can follow this tutorial [here](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto). Sidequest is an online platform which will give you access to many apps and games which are not available on the Oculus Store. 

# Loading the experiment to your headset

The experiment is available to download from [here].
