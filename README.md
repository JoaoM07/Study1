## This page provides information about the TurDaDial experiment,  the first study of my PhD project being run at the University of Exeter, UK. We are testing how VR can be used to study differences in wrist movement in healthy individuals. By taking part in this project, you are contributing to a piece of research which will help develop novel treatments for hand pain.Thanks for your interest in this project. Hopefully, you will find enough information about the study. Please, get in touch if you require more information or are willing to take part in the experiment.
